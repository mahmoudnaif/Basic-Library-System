# M&Z Library
This code was designed using the fundmentals of Data Structure (SLL, Queue)
# books
The code basicaly allows you to save your books in a text file and then you can access them using the program.
You can add/delete books and they will be effectively deleted in the text file too.
You can view all the books and you can check the number of a book by typing its name.
# Queue
The code connects a queue for each book that can be accessed using the index or its name.

Inside the queue there are multiple things that you can do like: adding a person to the queue, check who's turn it is to use the book,
You can also check customer's number in line and how many peopple are ahead of them and you can check the status of the whole Queue.

If you returned to the main menu and entered the queue again all of the data will be still reserverd

# Other
Destructors where used at the end to deleted all the dynamically created varaibles.
Note: I recommend exiting using the 0 number as mentioned in the program because if the program didn't stop correctly destructors won't activate therfore there will be no clean up.
